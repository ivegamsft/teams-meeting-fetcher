## Team Updates

📌 Team update (2026-02-25T01:30:00Z): EventHub processor Lambda fails with `consumer.subscribe(...).catch is not a function` at handler.js:207. Root cause: @azure/event-hubs returns Subscription object, not Promise. Secondary issue: consumer group mismatch ($Default vs lambda-processor). Needs try/catch refactor and config alignment. — decided by Redfoot

📌 Team update (2026-02-25T01:37:00Z): Fenster fixed the handler.js subscribe() bug by replacing `.catch()` with try/catch wrapper. Also fixed Terraform consumer group wiring in iac/main.tf (uses module.azure output instead of var default). Lambda deployed; Terraform changes pending manual deploy-unified.yml trigger. — decided by Fenster

📌 Team update (2026-02-26T14:56Z): Fenster completed webhook infrastructure: added Lambda env vars `ADMIN_APP_WEBHOOK_URL` and `WEBHOOK_AUTH_SECRET` to Terraform, integrated Secrets Manager, fixed deploy-undefined blockers (no keepers on suffix), and updated deploy-admin-app workflow to set Lambda webhook URL dynamically after IP discovery. Both deployments succeeded. — decided by Fenster

## Core Context (Summarized Learnings)

**Admin App Architecture:**
- Auth: Entra ID OIDC via `passport-azure-ad` (deprecated but functional). Routes at app level (`/auth/*`). API key auth (`x-api-key`) preserved for webhooks. Session-based via express-session.
- Entra config: `ENTRA_TENANT_ID`, `ENTRA_CLIENT_ID`, `ENTRA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ENTRA_REDIRECT_URI` (all Terraform-managed).

**Meetings Pipeline Architecture:**
- Graph API → EventHub → Lambda → S3 archive + DynamoDB direct-write (decoupled, Lambda writes directly to meetings table).
- DynamoDB composite key: `meeting_id` (partition) + `created_at` (sort). Query before PutItem via `meetingStore._resolveKey()`.
- Notification-only storage: Raw notification data on webhook receipt, full enrichment via GET `/api/meetings/{id}/details` or POST `/batch-fetch-details`.
- Meeting model fields: `meeting_id`, `created_at`, `status`, `resource`, `rawNotification`, `detailsFetched`, `rawEventData`, `changeType` ('created' | 'updated' | 'deleted').

**Webhook & Graph Subscriptions:**
- Graph subscriptions: user-scoped `/users/{id}/events` with EventHub notification URL. Created via app token (client_credentials flow).
- Webhook auth: `WEBHOOK_AUTH_SECRET` (Bearer token) + `WEBHOOK_CLIENT_STATE` (Graph validation). Separate from dashboard auth.
- `webhookAuth` middleware in `src/middleware/auth.ts`. Routes at `/api/webhooks/*` bypass `dashboardAuth`.

**Lambda & Infrastructure:**
- EventHub Lambda: Polls events, archives to S3, writes to DynamoDB meetings table. Env vars: `MEETINGS_TABLE_NAME`, `WEBHOOK_CLIENT_STATE` (Graph validation).
- Admin app: HTTPS with self-signed certs (Docker build). Lambda requires `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` for outbound HTTPS.
- Graph subscriptions active (as of 2026-02-27): 4 user-scoped subscriptions for Calendar events. Monitor group: `<YOUR_GROUP_ID>`.

**Scale Testing Insights:**
- Graph API latency: creates ~2.8-2.9s avg (p95 ~3.9s), mutations ~1.4-1.6s avg (no room provisioning). 100ms pacing prevents rate limiting.
- EventHub Lambda: Batches 100 notifications every ~15s, scales linearly at ~0.2 events/sec.
- S3 archive: Reliable source of truth for replay on failure. Can replay 390 notifications in ~90 seconds.
- Terraform deployment: `deploy-unified.yml` does NOT redeploy eventhub-processor Lambda (uses placeholder after plan). Manual or separate workflow required.

## Learnings

<!-- Recent work entries below -->

- **Global Auth Gate for Static Files (2026-03-06):** Found and fixed critical auth bypass: `express.static` and the catch-all `*` route in `app.ts` were mounted WITHOUT any auth middleware, allowing unauthenticated access to HTML, CSS, JS, and the SPA shell. Root cause: `dashboardAuth` was only applied to individual API sub-routes in `routes/index.ts`, never to static file serving. Fix: added `globalAuth` middleware in `middleware/auth.ts` mounted in `app.ts` between `/auth` routes and `express.static`. Unauthenticated browser requests now redirect to `/auth/login`; unauthenticated API requests get 401 JSON. Exemptions: `/health` (ECS probes), `/api/webhooks/*` (has own Bearer auth), `/api/auth/status` (login state check). Existing `dashboardAuth` on API sub-routes kept for defense in depth.

- **Re-enrichment for Updated Meetings (2026-03-05):** Fixed Phase 1 enrichment filter in transcriptPoller.ts to re-enrich meetings with `changeType: 'updated'` even when `detailsFetched: true`. Added `'processed'` to changeType union in Meeting model. After fetchDetails() completes, changeType resets to `'processed'` to prevent infinite re-enrichment. Three-file surgical fix: meeting.ts (model), transcriptPoller.ts (filter), meetingService.ts (reset). Permanent failure skip logic preserved.

📌 Team update (2026-02-27T19:25:31Z): Identified transcript pipeline gap — all pipeline pieces exist but nothing calls `checkForTranscript()`. EventHub Lambda writes meetings to DynamoDB and exits. Admin app's implementation is complete but never triggered. Two fix options proposed: (A) background poller in admin app, (B) event-driven Lambda trigger. Coordinator implemented Option A, deployed to 98.92.64.148:3000. Phase 2 (event-driven subscriptions) recommended for future scaling. — decided by McManus/Kobayashi

- **Transcript Pipeline Gap Analysis (2026-02-28):** Investigated why 1105 meetings show 0 transcripts processed. Found the "missing middle" — the admin app has complete transcript storage infrastructure (transcriptService, transcriptStore, Transcript model, DynamoDB table, S3 buckets, API routes) and the meeting-bot has full transcript fetch+delivery logic, but there is NO automated trigger connecting the EventHub Lambda's meeting notifications to the admin app's `meetingService.checkForTranscript()`. The EventHub Lambda writes meeting notifications to DynamoDB and exits — it never calls the admin app or triggers transcript fetching. The admin app's `checkForTranscript()` method exists but is never called by any route, scheduler, or worker. The meeting-bot handles transcript fetching independently for its own chat-posting use case but doesn't write to the admin app's DynamoDB transcripts table. Two paths to fix: (A) Add a background poller/worker to admin app that scans for completed meetings with `onlineMeetingId` and calls `checkForTranscript()`, or (B) Have the EventHub Lambda or a new Lambda invoke the admin app's transcript check after meeting status changes.
- **Graph Permission Grant (2026-02-27):**Audited Teams Meeting Fetcher SPN (<YOUR_GRAPH_APP_ID>) appRoleAssignments. OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All and OnlineMeetingRecording.Read.All already granted (Feb 24); only OnlineMeetings.Read.All was missing. Added via `az ad app permission add` + `az rest` POST. Fixed `scripts/grant-graph-permissions.ps1` with correct permission IDs. All 7 Graph permissions now verified on SPN.
- **AzureAD module deprecation:** Use `az ad app permission add` + `az rest` POST to `/servicePrincipals/{id}/appRoleAssignments` instead of deprecated AzureAD PowerShell module. Audit via `az rest --method GET --url "...appRoleAssignments"`. `az ad app permission admin-consent` may timeout but succeed server-side — always verify after.

## Cross-Agent Updates

📌 Team update (2026-02-27T02:23:00Z): Kobayashi completed Teams transcription configuration analysis. Critical blockers identified: (1) CsApplicationAccessPolicy missing (403 error on OnlineMeetings API), (2) Graph permissions missing (OnlineMeetings.Read.All, OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All, OnlineMeetingRecording.Read.All), (3) Isaac's account (user1@<YOUR_TENANT_DOMAIN>) NOT licensed for Teams Premium — only test users (trustingboar, boldoriole) are licensed. Full configuration checklist created with Layer 1-4 breakdown and PowerShell commands. User directive: subscription created for a-ivega is unnecessary. — decided by Kobayashi

📌 Team update (2026-02-27T18:28:00Z): DynamoDB pagination vulnerability investigated and fixed. Root cause: 6 unpaginated Scan operations across meetingStore, transcriptStore, and subscriptionStore silently truncate at 1MB limit, losing datasets >1MB. Coordinator applied ExclusiveStartKey pagination to all operations (commit 5e42f63, pushed). Pagination pattern now the store-layer standard to prevent data loss at scale. — coordinated by Keaton & McManus


📌 Team update (20260228T063050Z): Fenster found 81 meetings with stale/deleted Exchange event IDs causing retry storm in transcriptPoller.ts every 5-min cycle. Need permanent-failure marking to stop wasting Graph API calls.

- **Retry Storm Fix (2026-02-28):** Fixed transcriptPoller.ts Phase 1 to detect permanent enrichment failures (Graph 404 "not found in store", eventId="NA"/empty) and mark them with `enrichmentStatus: 'permanent_failure'` in DynamoDB via new `meetingStore.markEnrichmentFailed()`. Marked meetings are filtered out of future poller cycles. Transient errors (429, 500, network) still retry normally. Added `enrichmentStatus` and `enrichmentError` fields to Meeting interface.
- **Sales Blitz Script Scale-Down (2026-02-28):** Reduced all 3 sales-blitz scripts from 260 meetings (5 days x 26 slots x 2 reps) to 5 meetings (1 day x 5 morning slots x 1 rep). Mutations script uses fixed counts (1 rename, 1 cancel, 1 reschedule, 1 description) instead of percentages. Per Isaac's request.

📌 Team update (2026-02-28T07:00:00Z): Fenster fixed subscription renewal Lambda (missing `requests` dependency) and recreated webhook subscriptions for boldoriole and trustingboar. All Graph subscriptions now active. Pipeline restored to receive new meeting notifications. Entra URI and Lambda webhook URL updated for new IP 13.218.102.57. — decided by Fenster

- **onlineMeetingId Resolution Fix (2026-03-05):** Root cause of 0 transcripts: `fetchDetails()` tried to resolve onlineMeetingId via `/users/{organizerEmail}/onlineMeetings?$filter=JoinWebUrl eq '...'` but the onlineMeetings endpoint with app-only auth (CsApplicationAccessPolicy) requires a userId GUID, not email/UPN. Fix: added a `/users/{email}` → `id` GUID resolution step before calling onlineMeetings. Also added OData single-quote escaping for joinWebUrl. Pattern already existed in `discoverTranscriptsForUser()` — now consistent across both methods. File: `apps/admin-app/src/services/meetingService.ts`.
